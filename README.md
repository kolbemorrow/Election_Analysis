# Election Analysis

### Overview of Election Audit:
  To certify the results of the Colorado Congressional election, an audit must be conducted. Within this Python script we can automate the process of tallying total votes per candidate and per county, then calculate the percentage of the total votes cast to find the winner for the popular vote. The automation of this process ensures accuracy and efficiency during calculations, provided the data has been sufficiently cleaned for errors.

  This script could be modified to audit other congressional precinct, senatorial or various other US elections using data from a .csv file. By changing certain variable definitions within the script to match whatever raw data that is being audited, we can provide similar information for other elections. Additionally, this script could be applied to analyze things such as census response data. By modifying the vote tally to tally information such as age, gender, race, or income within a data file, we can calculate various demographic statistics.
